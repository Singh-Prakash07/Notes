+ Kubernetes is a container management technology developed in Google lab to manage containerized applications in different kind of environments such as physical, virtual, and cloud infrastructure. It is an open source system which helps in creating and managing containerization of application.

+ Kubernetes comes with a capability of automating deployment, scaling of application, and operations of application containers across clusters. It is capable of creating container centric infrastructure.

+ Following are some of the important features of Kubernetes.

1. Continuous development, integration and deployment
2. Containerized infrastructure
3. Application-centric management
4. Auto-scalable infrastructure
5. Environment consistency across development testing and production
6. Loosely coupled infrastructure, where each component can act as a separate unit
7. Higher density of resource utilization
8. Predictable infrastructure which is going to be created

+ One of the key components of Kubernetes is, it can run application on clusters of physical and virtual machine infrastructure. It also has the capability to run applications on cloud. It helps in moving from host-centric infrastructure to container-centric infrastructure.

+ Kubernetes follows client-server architecture. Wherein, we have master installed on one machine and the node on separate Linux machines.

+ etcd
It stores the configuration information which can be used by each of the nodes in the cluster. It is a high availability key value store that can be distributed among multiple nodes. It is accessible only by Kubernetes API server as it may have some sensitive information. It is a distributed key value Store which is accessible to all.

+ API Server
Kubernetes is an API server which provides all the operation on cluster using the API. API server implements an interface, which means different tools and libraries can readily communicate with it. Kubeconfig is a package along with the server side tools that can be used for communication. It exposes Kubernetes API.

+ Controller Manager
This component is responsible for most of the collectors that regulates the state of cluster and performs a task. In general, it can be considered as a daemon which runs in nonterminating loop and is responsible for collecting and sending information to API server. It works toward getting the shared state of cluster and then make changes to bring the current status of the server to the desired state. The key controllers are replication controller, endpoint controller, namespace controller, and service account controller. The controller manager runs different kind of controllers to handle nodes, endpoints, etc.

+ Scheduler
This is one of the key components of Kubernetes master. It is a service in master responsible for distributing the workload. It is responsible for tracking utilization of working load on cluster nodes and then placing the workload on which resources are available and accept the workload. In other words, this is the mechanism responsible for allocating pods to available nodes. The scheduler is responsible for workload utilization and allocating pod to new node.

+ A node is a working machine in Kubernetes cluster which is also known as a minion. They are working units which can be physical, VM, or a cloud instance.

+ Each node has all the required configuration required to run a pod on it such as the proxy service and kubelet service along with the Docker, which is used to run the Docker containers on the pod created on the node.
