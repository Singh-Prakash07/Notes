+ Kubernetes is a container management technology developed in Google lab to manage containerized applications in different kind of environments such as physical, virtual, and cloud infrastructure. It is an open source system which helps in creating and managing containerization of application.

+ Kubernetes comes with a capability of automating deployment, scaling of application, and operations of application containers across clusters. It is capable of creating container centric infrastructure.

+ Following are some of the important features of Kubernetes.

1. Continuous development, integration and deployment
2. Containerized infrastructure
3. Application-centric management
4. Auto-scalable infrastructure
5. Environment consistency across development testing and production
6. Loosely coupled infrastructure, where each component can act as a separate unit
7. Higher density of resource utilization
8. Predictable infrastructure which is going to be created

+ One of the key components of Kubernetes is, it can run application on clusters of physical and virtual machine infrastructure. It also has the capability to run applications on cloud. It helps in moving from host-centric infrastructure to container-centric infrastructure.

+ Kubernetes follows client-server architecture. Wherein, we have master installed on one machine and the node on separate Linux machines.

+ etcd
It stores the configuration information which can be used by each of the nodes in the cluster. It is a high availability key value store that can be distributed among multiple nodes. It is accessible only by Kubernetes API server as it may have some sensitive information. It is a distributed key value Store which is accessible to all.

+ API Server
Kubernetes is an API server which provides all the operation on cluster using the API. API server implements an interface, which means different tools and libraries can readily communicate with it. Kubeconfig is a package along with the server side tools that can be used for communication. It exposes Kubernetes API.

+ Controller Manager
This component is responsible for most of the collectors that regulates the state of cluster and performs a task. In general, it can be considered as a daemon which runs in nonterminating loop and is responsible for collecting and sending information to API server. It works toward getting the shared state of cluster and then make changes to bring the current status of the server to the desired state. The key controllers are replication controller, endpoint controller, namespace controller, and service account controller. The controller manager runs different kind of controllers to handle nodes, endpoints, etc.

+ Scheduler
This is one of the key components of Kubernetes master. It is a service in master responsible for distributing the workload. It is responsible for tracking utilization of working load on cluster nodes and then placing the workload on which resources are available and accept the workload. In other words, this is the mechanism responsible for allocating pods to available nodes. The scheduler is responsible for workload utilization and allocating pod to new node.

+ A node is a working machine in Kubernetes cluster which is also known as a minion. They are working units which can be physical, VM, or a cloud instance.

+ Each node has all the required configuration required to run a pod on it such as the proxy service and kubelet service along with the Docker, which is used to run the Docker containers on the pod created on the node.

+ A pod is a collection of containers and its storage inside a node of a Kubernetes cluster. It is possible to create a pod with multiple containers inside it. For example, keeping a database container and data container in the same pod.

+ There are two types of Pods −

1. Single container pod
2. MuReplica Set :

+ The purpose of Replica Set is to maintain a stable set of pod replicas running at any given time. As such, it is often used to guarantee the availability of a specified number of identical Pods.

 

+ Replication Controller : 

A Replication Controller ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any one time. In other words, a Replication Controller makes sure that a pod or a homogeneous set of pods is always up and available.

+ If there are too many pods, the Replication Controller terminates the extra pods. If there are too few, the Replication Controller starts more pods. Unlike manually created pods, the pods maintained by a Replication Controller are automatically replaced if they fail, are deleted, or are terminated.


+ A service can be defined as a logical set of pods. It can be defined as an abstraction on the top of the pod which provides a single IP address and DNS name by which pods can be accessed. With Service, it is very easy to manage load balancing configuration. It helps pods to scale very easily.

+ A service is a REST object in Kubernetes whose definition can be posted to Kubernetes apiServer on the Kubernetes master to create a new instance.

+ Types of Services

+ ClusterIP − This helps in restricting the service within the cluster. It exposes the service within the defined Kubernetes cluster.

+ NodePort − It will expose the service on a static port on the deployed node. A ClusterIP service, to which NodePort service will route, is automatically created. The service can be accessed from outside the cluster.

+ Load Balancer − It uses cloud providers’ load balancer. NodePort and ClusterIP services are created automatically to which the external load balancer will route.

+ Deployments are upgraded and higher version of replication controller. They manage the deployment of replica sets which is also an upgraded version of the replication controller. They have the capability to update the replica set and are also capable of rolling back to the previous version.

+ Deployments in Kubernetes
+ They provide many updated features of matchLabels and selectors. We have got a new controller in the Kubernetes master called the deployment controller which makes it happen. It has the capability to change the deployment midway.
  
+ Kubeadm, Kubectl, Kubelet

+ Kubernetes needs these 3 packages to be install on all your machines in a kubernetes cluster. 

1. Kubeadm : The component to bootstrap the cluster. Kubeadm commands needs to run on master node.

2. Kubectl : kubectl is a client for the Kubernetes API and It allows you to perform every possible Kubernetes operation on nodes.

3. Kubelet : The kubelet is the primary "node agent" that runs on each node and communicates with pods.
